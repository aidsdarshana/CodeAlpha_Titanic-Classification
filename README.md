🚀 Project Overview
The Titanic dataset serves as a valuable resource for understanding the factors that influenced survival rates during the tragic sinking of the ship. In this project, we leverage data science techniques to analyze the dataset and construct predictive models to ascertain the likelihood of survival based on passenger attributes.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-Learn
Matplotlib
Seaborn
📊 Dataset
The dataset for this project originates from the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It encompasses crucial information such as passenger class, gender, age, fare paid, and survival status.

🔍 Features
The analysis includes the following features:

Pclass: Passenger class (1, 2, or 3)
Sex: Gender of the passenger (male or female)
Age: Age of the passenger
SibSp: Number of siblings or spouses aboard
Parch: Number of parents or children aboard
Fare: Ticket fare
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)
💻 Installation
To run this project on your local machine, ensure you have Python installed. You can install the necessary libraries via pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
⚙️ Usage
Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/aidsdarshana/Titanic-Classification-CodeAlpha2024.git
Navigate into the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd Titanic-Classification-CodeAlpha2024
Launch the Jupyter Notebook:

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Titanic_Classification.ipynb
Follow the instructions provided in the notebook to conduct the analysis and view results.

📈 Results
In this project, we evaluated various machine learning models, such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest. The top-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset (replace with your actual accuracy).

🏁 Conclusion
The Titanic Classification project has provided meaningful insights into the determinants of survival aboard the Titanic. This practical experience has deepened my comprehension of data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation in machine learning.
